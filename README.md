# Morse-Code-
This project is about encoding text to morse code and vice versa  

## Work in Progress 

I have written both ascii to morse and morse to ascii converters , but since that was too easy I wanted to expand the project further 
Main ideas where the project could go :

 - Morse Code Translator:

    Create a web application or a command-line tool that allows users to input text and see the corresponding Morse code.
    Optionally, add the ability to input Morse code and translate it back to text.
    You can add features like audio playback of the Morse code, so users can hear the dots and dashes.

- Morse Code Trainer:

  Develop a game or an interactive learning platform that helps users practice and learn Morse code.
  The app can present random Morse code sequences and challenge the user to translate them to text, or vice versa.
  Include a scoring system, leaderboards, and progressive difficulty levels to make it engaging.

- Morse Code Communication:

  Create a simple communication system using Morse code, where two users can send messages to each other.
  This could be a web-based application, a desktop program, or even a mobile app.
  Users can input text, and the app will translate it to Morse code and transmit it to the other user, who can then decode the message.
  You can explore using various communication channels, such as audio tones, flashing lights, or even physical signaling devices.

- Morse Code Art:

  Develop a tool that allows users to create artistic designs or patterns using Morse code.
  Users can input text, and the app will generate a visual representation of the Morse code, such as a grid of dots and dashes.
  Provide customization options, like changing the size, color, and layout of the Morse code elements.
  The resulting "Morse code art" can be saved, shared, or even printed.
